# AI Video Dubbing Tool ðŸŽ¬ðŸ”Š

This is a Python application that uses AI to automatically dub videos into multiple languages (like Hindi, Tamil, Telugu, etc.) while retaining the original background music and generating new subtitles.

The app is built with a Streamlit interface, making it easy to use:
1.  Upload a video.
2.  Select a target language.
3.  Select a Whisper model (smaller = faster).
4.  Click "Start Dubbing".
5.  Download the final dubbed video and subtitle file.

## ðŸš€ How to Run This Project Locally

This is a complex project with many dependencies. Follow these steps carefully.

### 1. Prerequisites (Zaroori Cheezein)

-   **Python 3.9:** This project is tested and stable on **Python 3.9**. (Newer versions like 3.10+ may have issues with TensorFlow 2.9).
-   **ffmpeg.exe:** The `ffmpeg` program must be installed on your system and added to your PATH.
    -   Download link: [https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/) (download the `ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip` file).
    -   Extract it and add the `bin` folder's location (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg\bin`) to your System Environment `Path` variable.
-   **C++ Build Tools:** `spleeter` (via `tensorflow`) needs C++ tools to build.
    -   Download link: [Visual Studio Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
    -   Run the installer and select the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload.

### 2. Setup Virtual Environment

```bash
# Clone this repository (ya download zip)
git clone [https://github.com/AKASH6394-PATEL/AI-Video-Dubbing-Tool.git](https://github.com/AKASH6394-PATEL/AI-Video-Dubbing-Tool.git)
cd AI-Video-Dubbing-Tool

# Create a virtual environment using Python 3.9
# (Make sure 'py -3.9' points to your Python 3.9 installation)
py -3.9 -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
venv\Scripts\activate
